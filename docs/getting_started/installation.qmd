# Prerequisites
For more information about the prerequisites for an installation of the HydroMT package 
and related dependencies, please visit the documentation of 
[HydroMT core](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/getting_started/installation.html#installation-guide)

Compared to HydroMT, HydroMT plugin UWBM has additional dependencies, namely:

- [tomli](https://github.com/hukkin/tomli)
- list here other dependencies if any

If you already have a python & conda installation but do not yet have mamba installed, 
we recommend installing it into your *base* environment using:

```
  $ conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

# Installation
Explain how to install your plugin.

# Developper installation
To generate a usable mamba/conda environment youâ€™ll need to have tomli installed. You can simply install this with pip (only required for python < 3.11):

```
  $ pip install tomli
```

The first step is to create the environment.yml:

```
  $ python make_env.py full -n hydromt_plugin_uwbm
```

When the script is finished, a file called environment.yml will be created which you can pass to mamba as demonstrated in the sections below. This will include all mandatory and optional dependencies of HydroMT plugin UWBM.

After the environment file has been created you can create an environment out of it by running:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate hydromt_plugin_uwbm
```

Finally, create a developer installation of HydroMT:

```
pip install -e .
```
